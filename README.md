# Jablon

Jablon is a collection of software tools that build on top of Jablotron 100+ via JA-121T serial interface. 
The tools allow a third-party application to interact with Jablotron 100 by a standard RESTful interface. 

## JA-121T Emulator

When Jablotron 100 is not available for testing and development purposes, JA-121T emulator can be used to emulate the 
communication with the system.
