# $ ja2mqtt

**This is a DRAFT version, and not all commands below may work.**

ja2mqtt is a bridge that connects a Jablotron control unit, extended with the [JA-121T RS-485 bus interface](https://www.jablotron.com/en/produkt/rs-485-bus-interface-426/), to an MQTT broker.

ja2mqtt enables the use of MQTT events to control Jablotron events, allowing for seamless integration with MQTT-based IoT systems and platforms. With this bridge, Jablotron alarms can be integrated into a larger IoT ecosystem, alongside other devices that use industry-standard protocols like ZigBee or MQTT. For example, by using ja2mqtt in conjunction with ZigBee2MQTT, Jablotron alarms and ZigBee devices can be connected in a single network and integrated with other systems such as Alexa, Tahoma, or Google Assistant, providing a unified and interoperable smart home or industrial automation solution.

## Getting Started

To use ja2mqtt, you will need:

* Jablotron alarms with the control unit and the JA-121T serial interface connected to a serial port on your computer. The device uses RS485 interface, which can be connected to your computer using a [USB to RS485 adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-ch340-usb-rs485.html).

* A running instance of an MQTT broker. [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is the recommended MQTT broker, but others should also work without issues. You can run the MQTT broker on the same machine as ja2mqtt, on a separate machine, or use an existing instance of MQTT broker if you have one.

* Install ja2mqtt on a computer with access to the serial port where JA-121T is connected.

    ``pip install ja2mqtt``

* Download the sample configuration file and ja2mqtt definition file from the ja2mqtt GitHub repository. In the sample configuration file, you only need to define your Jablotron topology, such as section names and their numbers.
