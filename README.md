# $ ja2mqtt

ja2mqtt is a bridge between Jablotron control panel, which is equipped with [JA-121T RS-485 bus interface](https://www.jablotron.com/en/produkt/rs-485-bus-interface-426/), and a MQTT broker. Jablotron alarms are widely used in industrial and home alarm and automation systems, where a central control panel manages various devices such as motion sensors, sirens, cameras, and communication devices. These devices can be configured to perform different functions based on the needs of the user.

However, Jablotron systems typically use proprietary protocols that are not compatible with industry-standard IoT protocols such as ZigBee or MQTT. This can limit the interoperability of Jablotron systems with other IoT devices and platforms. To overcome this limitation, Jablotron control panels can be extended with the JA-121T RS-485 bus interface, which allows for programmable control of the Jablotron system over a serial interface.

ja2mqtt acts as a bridge that connects the Jablotron control panel, extended with the JA-121T RS-485 bus interface, with a MQTT broker. This enables the use of MQTT events to control Jablotron events, allowing for seamless integration with MQTT-based IoT systems and platforms. With this bridge, Jablotron alarms can be integrated into a larger IoT ecosystem, alongside other devices that use industry-standard protocols like ZigBee or MQTT. For example, by using ja2mqtt in conjunction with ZigBee2MQTT, Jablotron alarms and ZigBee devices can be connected in a single network and integrated with other systems such as Alexa, Tahoma, or Google Assistant, providing a unified and interoperable smart home or industrial automation solution.
