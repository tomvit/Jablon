# When serial.use_simulator is True, the below configuration defines how events will be generated for ja2mqtt

  # delay in seconds when responding to a command

  # list of rules that will generate sinulated events
  rules:
  # heartbeat every 10s
  - time_next: 10
    write: OK

  # prf state will occur once every 10-20 seconds
  - time_next: !py random(10,20)
    # this will write prfstate event for peripherials on positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    # on_prob is a probability of the ON state, (1-on_prob) is then the probability of the OFF state
